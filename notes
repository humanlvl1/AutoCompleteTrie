1. Complete the report for part 1 today. Hook up the big screen a the dining table and do it
dueal screen.

2. Notes for part 2;
	- Trie holding string keys (LOOK AT TRIES AGAIN)
	- Assume all characters of any word input are lower case
 	- a to z
	- For report; give pseudo code algorithm and algorithmic 
	description

	- TrieNode array of 26 (one per letter. Index 0 is a, index 1 is b etc). TrieNode
	contain this array.
	- Trie class. TrieNode as root. 
Create the Trie class, with all its method, and comment in notes about the algorithms.
